# google_trends
this was borne out of a desire to automate certain things such as data collection from google trends.
this project took me 5 hours to desgn and develop
i also contemplated alternate ways such as creating a function to handle all these actions and then simply making a call to it, thereby reducing how clogged the main file is.
but i decided to go for this current option since it is filled with a less redundant code. 
to execute this app: 
1. create an new csv file named keyword_list 
2. type in cell A1, "keyword"
3. under the A1 cell under keyword, write the items u have interests about. thanks
